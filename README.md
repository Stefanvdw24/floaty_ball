# Floaty Ball

A java project I did in my 3rd year in university. It is a video game coded from scratch. Specifically, it is a clone of the game Flappy Bird.

Right now this depository only serves to showcase coding work I have done. See the files in the "src" folder if this interests you.

To-do: make an exe file and a video of this program to demonstrate what the code does.
